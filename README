zsyntax core library
====================

This library is a Haskell implementation of an automated theorem
prover for Zsyntax, a logical calculus for molecular biology inspired
by linear logic, that can be used to automatically verify biological
pathways expressed as logical sequents.

The prover implements fully-automatic forward proof search for the
Zsyntax sequent calculus (ZBS), a logical calculus for a
context-sensitive fragment of multiplicative linear logic where
sequents are decorated so to account for the biochemical constraints.

The theory behind the Zsyntax sequent calculus and its proof search
procedure is developed in F. Sestini, S. Crafa, Proof-search in a
context-sensitive logic for molecular biology, Journal of Logic and
Computation, 2018 (https://doi.org/10.1093/logcom/exy028).

GUI application
===============

Version 0.1 of Zsyntax comes with a GUI for MacOS, that I have
not ported to the current version yet. See the "Releases" page,
or checkout the "0.1" tag in this repository.
